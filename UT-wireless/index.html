    <h2> Connecting to the UT restricted.utexas.edu wireless network in
        Linux (Ubuntu 7.04) </h2>
    <p>
        This document describes what I did to access the
        "restricted.utexas.edu" wireless network at UT. Your mileage may
        vary.  UT ITS provides <a
        href="https://management.pna.utexas.edu/static/faqs/dot1x/dot1x-linux.html">
        instructions for connecting to the wireless network using
        Linux</a>.  This page is applicable to <a
        href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyFawn">Ubuntu Feisty Fawn
        7.04</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ubuntu comes with Gnome's <a
        href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager/">NetworkManager</a>
        which makes connecting to wireless networks a lot easier than it
        was in the past.  NetworkManager (present as a small icon on the
        top right corner of the screen) shows a list of wireless networks.
        Choose "restricted.utexas.edu".
        <img src="choose.png" alt="Choose restricted.utexas.edu as your
        wireless network" />
    </p>

    <p>
        Choosing this network pops up a window asking for some login
        information. Enter details as shown in the figure below. The only
        field that deserves mention is "CA Certificate File". This file is
        the text file obtained by following steps 1-5 of the <a
        href="https://management.pna.utexas.edu/static/faqs/dot1x/dot1x-linux.html">instructions
        provided by UT ITS</a>. You can also download it <a
        href="ThawtePremiumServerCA_b64.txt">here</a>. I am not a lawyer,
        but to the best of my knowledge and understanding, the <a
        href="http://www.thawte.com/roots/">Thawte Root Certificate License
        Agreement</a> does not prevent me from making this certificate file
        available here. You should follow the instructions provided by ITS
        to make sure you got the right certificate file.
        <img src="configure.png" alt="Enter details" />
    </p>

    <p>
        At this point, you should be able to connect to the
        restricted.utexas.edu wireless network. I hope these instructions
        were useful.
