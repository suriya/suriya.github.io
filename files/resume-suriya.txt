EXPERIENCE
  Graduate Research Assistant
  Jan '07 - May '10
  Graduate Research Assistant with Dr. Kathryn McKinley.  Worked on supporting
  Dynamic Software Updates in Java.

  Teaching Assistant
  Aug '07 - Dec '07
  Teaching Assistant for "Advanced Compiler Techniques," instructor Dr.  Keshav
  Pingali, (Fall 2007), Department of Computer Science, The University of Texas
  at Austin.  Responsibilities included holding office hours, conducting
  tutorial sessions, designing and grading assignments. The Department of
  Computer Science awarded me a "TA Excellence Award - Honorable Mention."

  Graduate Intern
  May '06 - Aug '06
  Internship in the ICC Compiler group at Intel, Santa Clara.  Mentor: David
  Sehr. I worked on "Threading support by compiler instrumentation." I added a
  compiler phase to ICC to statically instrument memory instructions. These
  instrumented instructions make calls to a runtime system, that helps detect
  dependences that inhibit parallelism. To demonstrate the utility of this
  approach, we worked on instrumenting and parallelizing ICC.

  Graduate Research Assistant
  May '04 - December '06
  Member of the TRIPS compiler team. Worked on array layout and loop reordering
  optimizations in the Scale compiler for improving memory accesses to the
  banked L-1 data cache in the TRIPS processor. I also worked on profiling of
  memory accesses, and feeding this data back to the TRIPS scheduler, to help
  place memory operations on the grid in an efficient manner.  During this
  time, I also implemented the PowerPC/Linux backend for the Scale compiler.

  Teaching Assistant
  Jan '05 - May '05
  Teaching Assistant for "Introduction to Operating Systems (Honors),"
  instructor Dr. Mike Dahlin (Spring 2005), Department of Computer Science, The
  University of Texas at Austin. Responsibilities included holding office hours
  and grading programming assignments.

  Teaching Assistant
  Aug '04 - Dec '04
  Teaching Assistant for "Graduate Compilers," instructor Dr. Kathryn McKinley,
  (Fall 2004), Department of Computer Science, The University of Texas at
  Austin.  Responsibilities included holding office hours, grading homeworks,
  setting up infrastructure, preparing programming assignments and automated
  testing of assignments.

  Systems administrator
