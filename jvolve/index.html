<h1>Jvolve</h1>

<p>Jvolve is a Java VM with Dynamic Software Updating (DSU) support. DSU is a
general-purpose mechanism that updates from an old version to a newer
version of a program while it is running. DSU does not impose any special
software or hardware architecture. For more details refer to our PLDI 2009
paper, "Dynamic Software Updates: A VM-centric Approach" <a href="../papers/jvolve-pldi.pdf">PDF</a>
<a href="../papers/jvolve-pldi.bib">bibtex</a>.</p>

<div class="caution">
This release of Jvolve is meant for researchers. Jvolve is not yet
available for users to download, install and update their applications. We
hope to get there some day.

<h2>Downloading source</h2>

<p>Source code is maintained using Mercurial, a distributed version control
system. Before you get started, ensure that you have mercurial installed.</p>

<p>This page contains information on how to download and use Jvolve. There are
three components (and their corresponding repositories) that you need to
download. They are</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://bitbucket.org/suriya/jvolve">Jvolve</a>, the VM. Jvolve is built on top of Jikes RVM, a very popular
research JVM.</li>
<li><a href="http://bitbucket.org/suriya/upt">UPT</a>, for Update Preparation Tool. This is our offline analysis software
that compares bytecodes of two versions and provides a specification of the
update to the VM.</li>
<li><a href="http://bitbucket.org/suriya/jastaddj">JastAddJ</a>. We have made some minor modifications to JastAddJ to compile
our object and class transformer functions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Download the above repositories using Mercurial.</p>

<pre><code>hg clone -r f8fcedddb95e http://bitbucket.org/suriya/jvolve
hg clone                 http://bitbucket.org/suriya/upt
hg clone                 http://bitbucket.org/suriya/jastaddj JastAddJ
</code></pre>

<h2>Building Jvolve</h2>

<p>Jvolve has been tested to work on ia32-osx and ia32-linux platforms.
Before we build Jvolve, let us build UPT and JastAddJ, both of which are
straightforward to build. They require nothing more than JDK and Apache
ant.</p>

<pre><code># Build UPT
cd upt
ant
cd ..

# Build JastAddJ
cd JastAddJ/Java1.5Backend
ANT_OPTS="-Xmx256M" ant jar
cd ..
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let us get to building and testing Jvolve. Jvolve's requirements are
the same as those of JikesRVM. If every thing in your system is right, you
should be able to build Jvolve and run about 25 DSU-specific regression
tests with a single command. The entire command should take about 5 minutes
to run.</p>

<pre><code>cd jvolve
# Command for building and testing
./bin/buildit    localhost --test-run jvolve
# Command for building alone (for use later)
./bin/buildit localhost 
# Command for running DSU-specific regression tests
./bin/buildit localhost BaseAdaptiveSemiSpaceDSU
</code></pre>

<p>Now is a good time to explain what BaseAdaptiveSemiSpaceDSU means. JikesRVM
comes with various build flavors that represent different choices of JIT
compilers and Garbage collectors. Jvolve requires JikesRVM's adaptive
compilation system and is built on top of a semi-space copying collector.
For more information look in <tt>jvolve/build/configs/</tt>.</p>

<p>If you have trouble building Jvolve, check if you are able to build a stock
version of Jikes RVM.</p>

<pre><code>cd jvolve
# Switch the JikesRVM trunk
hg up -r trunk
./bin/buildit    localhost BaseAdaptiveSemiSpace
# Switch back to Jvolve
hg up -r suriya-dsu
</code></pre>

<h2>Dynamically updating an application</h2>

<p>Before we update an actual
application, let us get to know how to trigger the VM to perform a dynamic
update. There are a few command line options when invoking the VM that
control DSU behavior. They are</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>-X:vm:dsuSpecificationFile=filename</tt> to specify the specification file
obtained from UPT</li>
<li><tt>-X:vm:enableDsuOsr=true|false</tt> to control whether or not we want
to utilize On-stack replacement for DSU</li>
<li><tt>-X:vm:enableDsuReturnBarriers=true|false</tt> to control whether or
not we want to allow the use of return barriers for DSU</li>
<li><tt>-X:vm:enableDsuDeveloperInterface=true|false</tt> Jvolve provides an
API to invoke DSU from within a Java program. This flag controls whether
or not we allow this API.</li>
</ul>

<p>The source code contains the most precise information about these flags.
You can look up options introduced in Jvolve by comparing it to existing
options in JikesRVM by</p>

<pre><code>hg diff -r trunk rvm/src-generated/options
</code></pre>

<p>There are two ways to trigger DSU:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using Jvolve's Java API  applications can invoke the method
<tt>org.jikesrvm.dsu.DeveloperInterface.invokeDSU()</tt> from within the
program. Jvolve's regression tests use this feature. Take a look at
code in <tt>testing/tests/jvolve/src</tt>. These regression tests have
two directories <tt>r0/</tt> and <tt>r1/</tt> corresponding to two
versions of the application. The VM starts running version <tt>r0</tt>
and updates to <tt>r1</tt> when the programmer calls
<tt>invokeDSU()</tt>. The specification file (whose format is not
documented anywhere yet) is available in these directories as
<tt>dsu-specification.txt</tt>. Class and object transformers for the
update reside in the <tt>transformers/</tt> directory of each test.</li>
<li>By signalling the VM. Jvolve uses <tt>SIGUSR1</tt> for this purpose.
Either <tt>killall -USR1 JikesRVM</tt> or <tt>kill -USR1 PID</tt> will
trigger a dynamic update.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparing the update specification</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, Jvolve provides a command line option to specify an
update specification file. UPT creates a specification file and code for
class and object transformers from the jar files for the old and new
versions. UPT can be invoked as follows.</p>

<pre><code>upt/bin/upt.sh -a old-jar-file -b new-jar-file \
    -c path-where-new-jar-file-will-be-placed-for-the-vm \
    -p a-prefix-to-generate-old-version-stubs
</code></pre>

<p>For example,</p>

<pre><code>upt/bin/upt.sh -a r0/application.jar -b r1/application.jar \
    -c /complete/path/to/r1/application.jar \
    -p r0_
</code></pre>

or suggestions, please feel free to contact Suriya Subramanian at
